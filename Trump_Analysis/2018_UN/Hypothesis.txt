Trump is viewed as a populist (Prof. Susan Hunston, [1]) by many due to his use of language. 
My hypothesis is that in comparison to a traditional leader type such as President Macron, President Trump is likely to use more 
volatile words to evoke emotional reactions instead of trying to convey an idea or vision, this can be studied using sentiment analysis. I will analyse the complexity
of his speech by examining how repetitive his speech is and the frequency of simple words when compared to the same analysis of Macron's speech.   

“There is, then, evidence that Trump’s language is highly distinctive, but that this distinctiveness aligns him with scenarios of casual conversation. 
	Although his language, both in content and in style, is odd for a political leader, it is familiar to his audience. It is the true language of populism.” - [1]

By scraping the text of his September 2018 speech at the UN, that he was famously laughed at by attending world leaders for, as published by Politco [2].

A comparison will then be made to President Macron's speech at the same UN summit [3], who is considered to be a centrist liberal as opposed to Trump who in the present day is a, heavily right leaning, Republican. 
However he Trump has previously flip-flopped between the Democratic and Reform parties, and aligned as an Independent.This suggests further that he follows a populist ideaology or could simply 
be honest and willing to change his views.  

The comparisons goal is to see if there are any key differences between the leaders in terms of word complexity, and sentiment. 
For my sentiment analysis I will be using the numerical AFINN (Finn, Arup, Nielsen) lexicon.
I will carry out further analysis using the nrc (Saif Mohammed and Peter Turney), to study the categorisation of the unigrams (single words). 
This lexicon assigns words with a score from -5 to 5, with negative values representing a negative sentiment. 
I will then go on to see what these differences or similarities could imply based on the findings of linguistic studies.
